To run these S3-compatible storage operations (e.g., upload, download, list, copy, move, delete, metadata retrieval) in Postman, you can create individual requests using the Hitachi Vantara S3-compatible API and customize them with headers and parameters to accomplish each operation. Below, I’ll go through how to set up each request in Postman.

1. Setup: Base URL and Authentication

	•	Base URL: Use your Hitachi Vantara endpoint (e.g., https://your-s3-endpoint).
	•	Authentication: For S3-compatible API, you’ll typically use AWS Signature Version 4 for authentication.
	•	In Postman, go to Authorization tab, select AWS Signature from the dropdown.
	•	Enter your Access Key, Secret Key, Region, and Service Name (usually s3).

2. Upload a File with Metadata

Method: PUT
URL: https://your-s3-endpoint/{bucket_name}/{object_key}

Headers:

	•	x-amz-meta-author: user1 (for custom metadata)
	•	x-amz-meta-project: project-name
	•	Content-Type: application/octet-stream (or appropriate file type)

Body:

	•	Select Binary and upload the file from your local system.

Example:

	•	Bucket Name: my-bucket
	•	Object Key: folder/file.txt

URL:

https://your-s3-endpoint/my-bucket/folder/file.txt

Custom Metadata Headers:

	•	Add x-amz-meta-<metadata_key> headers for each custom metadata item you want to include.

3. Download a File

Method: GET
URL: https://your-s3-endpoint/{bucket_name}/{object_key}

Example:

	•	Bucket Name: my-bucket
	•	Object Key: folder/file.txt

URL:

https://your-s3-endpoint/my-bucket/folder/file.txt

	•	To download, hit Send; the file contents will display as the response body. You can also save it to your local file system.

4. List Files in a Folder

Method: GET
URL: https://your-s3-endpoint/{bucket_name}?prefix={folder_prefix}

Example:

	•	Bucket Name: my-bucket
	•	Folder Prefix: folder/sub-folder/

URL:

https://your-s3-endpoint/my-bucket?prefix=folder/sub-folder/

	•	Note: To view the files in a specific “folder,” use the prefix parameter with the folder path.

5. Move (Rename) a File

To move a file, you copy it to a new location and delete the original.

Copy the File

Method: PUT
URL: https://your-s3-endpoint/{bucket_name}/{new_object_key}

Headers:

	•	x-amz-copy-source: /{bucket_name}/{source_object_key}

Example:

	•	Bucket Name: my-bucket
	•	Source Object Key: folder/old-file.txt
	•	New Object Key: folder/new-folder/new-file.txt

URL:

https://your-s3-endpoint/my-bucket/folder/new-folder/new-file.txt

Delete the Original File

After copying, delete the original file.

Method: DELETE
URL: https://your-s3-endpoint/{bucket_name}/{source_object_key}

Example:

	•	Bucket Name: my-bucket
	•	Object Key: folder/old-file.txt

URL:

https://your-s3-endpoint/my-bucket/folder/old-file.txt

6. Delete a File

Method: DELETE
URL: https://your-s3-endpoint/{bucket_name}/{object_key}

Example:

	•	Bucket Name: my-bucket
	•	Object Key: folder/file-to-delete.txt

URL:

https://your-s3-endpoint/my-bucket/folder/file-to-delete.txt

7. Retrieve Metadata for a File

Method: HEAD
URL: https://your-s3-endpoint/{bucket_name}/{object_key}

Example:

	•	Bucket Name: my-bucket
	•	Object Key: folder/file.txt

URL:

https://your-s3-endpoint/my-bucket/folder/file.txt

	•	Response Headers: The metadata will appear in the headers with the prefix x-amz-meta-.

8. Copy a File

Method: PUT
URL: https://your-s3-endpoint/{bucket_name}/{destination_object_key}

Headers:

	•	x-amz-copy-source: /{bucket_name}/{source_object_key}

Example:

	•	Bucket Name: my-bucket
	•	Source Object Key: folder/file.txt
	•	Destination Object Key: folder/backup/file_copy.txt

URL:

https://your-s3-endpoint/my-bucket/folder/backup/file_copy.txt

Summary

Each request example should be customized with the bucket, object key, and any metadata you want to add. By using these configurations in Postman, you can perform each of the requested operations directly against your Hitachi Vantara S3-compatible storage. Let me know if there’s anything else you need to set up!
