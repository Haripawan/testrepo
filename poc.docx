Here’s a structured POC write-up draft you can use for your Oracle 23ai initiative. I’ve kept it business-friendly but also technical enough to highlight the capabilities you’re exploring:
 
Proof of Concept (POC) – Oracle Database 23ai for ISO Payments Data

Objective

The goal of this POC is to evaluate Oracle Database 23ai for managing, searching, and analyzing ISO 20022 payments data. The focus is on leveraging Oracle’s new semi-structured, AI-driven, and graph-enabled features to address real-world challenges in storing, processing, and deriving insights from large volumes of payments data.
 
Scope of Work

1. 
Semi-Structured Data Storage (JSON + Wide Tables)
•	Store ISO 20022 payment messages in Oracle 23ai using the native JSON data type.
•	Explore wide table modeling to efficiently handle flattened ISO elements while retaining flexibility for unstructured fields.
•	Benchmark query performance and storage efficiency between purely JSON vs. hybrid JSON + wide table schema design.
•	Validate Oracle’s automatic indexing and schema evolution support for ISO message variants.
 
2. 
Semantic & Vector Search
•	Investigate Oracle’s integration with vector databases to enable semantic similarity search on payments data.
•	Use embeddings to identify similar payment messages, detect anomalies, and cluster transactions.
•	Compare traditional SQL keyword searches with vector-based semantic search for scenarios like fraud detection and duplicate transaction identification.
 
3. 
AI Use Case: GraphRAG with Property Graphs
•	Build a property graph model on top of ISO payments data (nodes: accounts, transactions, counterparties; edges: relationships such as “sends”, “receives”, “owns”).
•	Explore GraphRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation with Graphs) for contextual AI responses grounded in payments metadata.
•	Assess query patterns where graph traversal + AI reasoning can uncover complex transaction linkages (e.g., hidden relationships in payment chains).
 
4. 
Advanced Oracle 23ai Features
•	Evaluate In-Memory Columnar Store for real-time analytical queries over payments history.
•	Explore Autonomous indexing and workload optimization to reduce manual tuning.
•	Test vector data type support alongside JSON and graph for multimodal use cases.
•	Validate integration of Oracle 23ai’s enhanced SQL over JSON for flexible yet performant access patterns.
 
Expected Outcomes
1.	A validated data model for ISO payments using JSON + wide tables.
2.	Benchmarks comparing traditional SQL search vs. vector similarity search.
3.	A prototype GraphRAG implementation for enhanced AI-driven insights.
4.	A performance report on Oracle 23ai advanced features (in-memory, columnar, indexing).
5.	Recommendations for production architecture based on findings.
 
Business Benefits
•	Flexibility: Simplified handling of evolving ISO message formats.
•	Efficiency: Faster analytics and anomaly detection through in-memory + columnar processing.
•	Innovation: Modern AI capabilities (semantic search, GraphRAG) natively integrated with enterprise data.
•	Future-readiness: Aligns payment data infrastructure with Oracle’s next-gen AI database stack.
